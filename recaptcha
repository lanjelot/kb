# recaptcha

02:19 < lanjelot> hi guys, i'm looking into stiltwakler v2 because the audio recaptcha used by the website i am pentesting gives 3 groups of 3 digits
02:20 < lanjelot> and sometimes, 1 group of 4 digits and 2 groups of 3 digits
02:29 < lanjelot> stiltwalkerv2 fails at guessing the 9 digits
02:37 < lanjelot> i've changed number_of_words_per_piece and number_of_pieces to 3 of course
02:38 < lanjelot> but the fuckit_splitter fails at splitting the .mp3 correctly i guess, as some of the .wav contain more than 1 digit
03:30 -!- jeffball [~jeff@c-69-242-197-112.hsd1.sc.comcast.net] has joined #dc-949
04:54 < lanjelot> i've modified fuckit_splitter.py with pixels[x,y][0] >= 250 and pixels[x,y][1] >= 200 to have 3 groups right away
04:55 < lanjelot> and i've changed sample_rate = 16000  in splitterbase.py
04:56 < lanjelot> the different .wav match every digits better now, but the guesses are still all wrong :(
05:05 < lanjelot> do i need to train the neural network?
05:31 < jeffball> it's been a while since I trained it, so I aplogize if some steps are incomplete
05:31 < jeffball> but essentially you need a directory in the format of: solved_clusters/answer/sample.wav
05:32 < jeffball> where solved_clusters is the root (name it anything), answer is the letter/digit/word that matches all the samples in that directory
05:32 < jeffball> and sample###.wav is just any filename under that directory.  The more samples you get the better
05:34 < jeffball> then run s-plot/splotitup.sh on it: cd s-plot; splotitup.sh solved_clusters/ dat/ $bitmask
05:35 < jeffball> where bitmask is the type of data you want to train on.  See splot.py for a description.  Generally we used 24, but 8 and 32 worked alright too
05:37 < jeffball> this generates dat/*.csv for each word/digit/letter.
05:37 < jeffball> *Just noticed s-plot/README.txt*
05:56 < jeffball> then run generate_ml_inputs.sh, this will convert those csv's into octave's format in trainingsetx.csv, trainingsety.csv, and y_mappings.txt
05:57 < jeffball> they'll get copied to image-neural-network folder
05:58 < jeffball> then you can run image-neural-network/trainNN3.m with octave: octave trainNN3.m arguments
05:58 < jeffball> Usage: octave trainNN3.m inputs hidden iterations save_every name_prefix inputx inputy output
05:59 < jeffball> and that will create the theta values you can use to solve with.
06:09 < lanjelot> right, i just remembered downloading the corpus. I understand now why the sample_rate was hard-coded
06:19 < lanjelot> jeffball: how come the recaptcha that this website is using looks like it could be solved by stiltwalker?
06:21 < lanjelot> didn't Google roll back reCAPTCHA to the difficult version (for humans) after you released stiltwalker v3?
06:22 < lanjelot> or is it that reCAPTCHA customers can choose to have an old version, hence usable for blind people
11:52 < jeffball> reCAPTCHA switched to a had version but then moved towards a different version with just quick numbers, similar to round 2
11:53 < jeffball> it's different in that the number of digits in each of the 3 sections is varriable (mostly 3 or 4), perhaps to try to mess with the fuckit splitter.  Their goal is not that you can't decipher 
                  the digits, but that you can't split them.  In all honesty it's probably capable of being broken, but we just haven't the time/motivation to release another round
11:54 < jeffball> if you get splitting to work, do a bnuch of the captchas and retrain, you'll probably break it
11:54 < jeffball> *switched to a bad version
12:46 < lanjelot> cool thx for clarifying that up
