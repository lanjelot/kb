# remote debugging with ida
Press F9 in IDA and select "Remote Linux Debugger", then configure the process options, below mine:

The next step is to copy the your linux_server binary from "dbgsrv" folder in IDA to your backtrack machine and run it:

root@bt:~/IDA# ./linux_server
IDA Linux 32-bit remote debug server(ST) v1.17. Hex-Rays (c) 2004-2013
Listening on port #23946...

Set any breakpoint in IDA(F2) and click on Debugger->Start Process (F9). You are ready to start debugging and with the power of IDA to document everything as you go!
